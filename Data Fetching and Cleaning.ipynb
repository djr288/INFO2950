    "Next, every school which had coordinates that could not be determined by referencing the name of the city it resided in (usually very small cities, or Chicago by design) had to be manually determined. Each school was identified after a first pass of the data collection process (the cells further below this one). To place the most probable location of the school when it existed (as mot schools that could not be determined were schools that no longer existed), I manually cross-referenced the respective school websites, if they still existed, with information compiled from http://www.illinoishsglorydays.com/ and Wikipedia. Although these websites are unreliable and compiled by anonymous individuals, each manually-determined set of coordinates was checked on Google Maps street view and Google Images to see if the buildings look similar to historic photos, for example, and it is highly unlikely that any building is listed as more than a mile from where it truly was. The schools that were manually entered were determined to have coordinates as follows:\n",
